TWI stands for \u201cTwo-Wire Interface\u201d and it\u2019s another way to call the I2C bus technology. Basically it allows to connect multiple devices in series. This means that you can hook a large number of LCD screens, connecting them \u201cin-line\u201d using the two TWI ports, one for input and one for output. One of them must be the master (or you can use a TInkerKit! shield), while the others must run the TWI firmware. The TWI port has four pins, that\u2019s why we need the 4-pin jumper wire (Molex KK 2.54mm) cable to connect them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial":{"id":"tutorial","title":"Tutorial Intro","description":"Nothing here right now.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
