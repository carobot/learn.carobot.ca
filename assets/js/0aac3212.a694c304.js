The Teensy\nseries of microcontrollers boast dozens more pins than the Arduino or Raspberry Pi boards,\nwith more user-defined protocols. The form factor is also a consiteration, and the Teensy,\nliving up to its name, is only 61mm long and 18mm wide, making it excaption for embedded\nroles where size is a premium. In that the screen-accurate Lightsabers are a maximum 50mm\nwide outer diameter, this board is the only suitable choice so build on. The Teensy 4.1 also\nincludes a micro SD card slot, meaning the sound files to be played can be saved on the SD\ncard, saving valuable onbaord memory, and they can be changed easily by swapping SD\ncards. The filenames of the sounds must remain the same, unless the code is changed to\naccomodate new sound files.\nThe Teensy Prop shield is both an IMU, with gyroscope and 3-axis accelerator, and\nand an RGB LED driver and 2 Watt single channel amplifier. The Teensy has libraries\nspecifically for the Propshield IMU but can also accept Arduino libraries for LED control. The\namplifier and soundboard have a GUI based tool that can be used to program sound triggers\nfor actions or they can be coded by the user, depending on their preference.\nA singular drawback to these two boards is in the sound operation. The Teensy 4.x\nseries board removed the DAC from the 3.x series, meaning the Propshiel no longer has a\nmating pin on the Teensy board. The Teensy 4.x series does have 2 Medium Quality Sound\npins, on pins 10 and 12, and we used a jumper wire to connect one of these to the input pin\non Propshield. This would normally degrade the sound quality, but Lightsaber sounds are by\nnature low resolution, and may in fact be improved by increased noise and distortion.\nThe rest of the materials were selected from off-the-shelf components in the shop: waterproof\nRGB LEDs, 18650 lithium battery, 5v up-converter, switches. We selected machinehead\npinheaders in order to maintain a low profile with the stacked boards."]})]})}function l(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}}}]);
