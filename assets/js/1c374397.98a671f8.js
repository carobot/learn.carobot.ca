The new IOREF allows shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the Arduino. The second pin is not connected. The R3 also features a stronger RESET circuit and an ATmega16U2 replaced the 8U2 for better USB communication. The SMD (Surface-Mount Device) version of the Arduino Uno is exactly the same as the PTH (Plated Through-Hole) version in terms of functionality. The only difference is the size of the chip and its manufacturing process.
