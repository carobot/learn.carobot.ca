### General Safety Guidelines
1. **Read Instructions Carefully:** Always read and understand all instructions before starting your project.
2. **Work in a Well-Lit Area:** Ensure your workspace is well-lit to avoid mistakes and accidents.
3. **Keep Your Workspace Organized:** A tidy workspace helps prevent accidents and makes it easier to find tools and components.
4. **Use Tools Properly:** Always use tools for their intended purpose and follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
5. **Stay Focused:** Pay attention to your work and avoid distractions that could lead to mistakes or injuries.
6. **Take Breaks:** If you feel tired or frustrated, take a short break to rest and refocus.

### Specific Precautions for the Project
1. **Handling Sharp Tools:**
    * **Knives and Cutters:** Always cut away from your body and keep your fingers clear of the cutting path.
    * **Drill Bits and Saw Blades:** Use clamps to secure materials when drilling or sawing. Keep hands clear of moving parts.
2. **Using Electrical Components:**
    * **Motor and Gears:** Make sure the power source is disconnected when assembling or adjusting electrical components.
    * **Glue Gun:** Handle the glue gun carefully. The tip can become very hot and cause burns. Allow glue to cool before touching.
3. **Chemical Safety:**
    * **Glue and Grease:** Do not consume accidentally. Wash hands after use.

## Adult Supervision Recommendations
1. **Supervision for Power Tools:** Always have an adult present when using power tools such as drills and saws.
2. **Safety Gear Usage:** Make sure you are using appropriate safety gear, such as goggles and gloves, when necessary. Consult an adult about the appropriate Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and ensure correct usage at all times.
3. **Emergency:** Have a first aid kit readily available and know the location of the nearest emergency exit.
