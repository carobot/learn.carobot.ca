## How To Assemble Your Windmill
**Step 1:** To begin, you will need to assemble the base structure of your wind turbine using the PVC tubes and connectors. Be creative!\
**Step 2:** Follow the Gearbox Kit Assembly Instructions below.\
**Step 3:** Now screw the windhub onto the drive shaft.\
**Step 4:** Design your vanes and attach onto the windhub.

# Gearbox Kit Assembly Instructions
For the purpose of this competition, only the parts shown from the provided gearbox kit will be used in the build of your wind turbines. Please follow these instructions carefully. The extra parts that are not used can be placed back in the packaging.
