## Library Introduction and Installation

For this starter kit, we are going to use many libraries, so we should know how to install library into
our Arduino IDE

To install a library (e.g: adafruit_GFX.h):
1. Search for adafruit_GFX.h arduino library
2. Download the latest version under .zip format
3. Open Arduino IDE
4. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .Zip Library
5. Select adafruit_GFX.h file that you just downloaded

Before jumping into writing code, letâ€™s take a look at what libraries and methods we are going to use.
For each library, you can read its document online. However, I have documented necessary libraries
and methods we will use in this repository (#to be included later).
