Photos shown are for the working prototype. Pay attention to the wiring from ESP32 to
various peripherals. It is also recommended to survey additional peripherals such as the
rotary encoder for smoother UI-navigation, LED bar-graph with LM3914 (for displaying an
analog bar-graph of the WiFi network), and microphone for natural language processing,
etc.
