This project aims to develop a simple yet effective ethanol detection module using the MQ3 alcohol sensor. The [MQ3 sensor](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/2175) is capable of detecting ethanol vapours in the air and providing an analog output that varies with the concentration of ethanol detected. By integrating this sensor with an Arduino microcontroller and an OLED display, we can create a device that not only detects the presence of ethanol but also visually represents the concentration levels.

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To demonstrate the capability of the MQ3 sensor in detecting ethanol.
- To process the sensor's analog output using an Arduino.
- To display the ethanol concentration levels on an OLED screen in a user-friendly manner.

This ethanol detector can be applied in various scenarios, such as personal alcohol consumption monitoring, supporting medical conditions that affect ethanol production in the body, monitoring air quality, and educational projects.
