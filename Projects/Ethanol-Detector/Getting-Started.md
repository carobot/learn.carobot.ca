## Software Setup
#### Downloading Arduino IDE:
1. Visit the Arduino website and download the latest version of the Arduino IDE for your operating system.
2. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

#### Connecting the Arduino Board:
1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Ensure the connection is secure. Sometimes a loose connection can cause the board to be not recognized. A tight connection resolved this issue for me (thanks to a helpful YouTube comment).

#### Installing Required Libraries:
1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
3. In the Library Manager, search for and install the following libraries:
    - Adafruit GFX Library: This core graphics library provides a common set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.) and needs to be paired with a hardware-specific library.
    - Adafruit SSD1306 OLED Display Library: This library is specifically for OLED displays based on SSD1306 drivers.

#### Setting Up the Arduino IDE:
1. Select your Arduino board model under Tools > Board.
2. Select the correct port under Tools > Port where your Arduino is connected.
