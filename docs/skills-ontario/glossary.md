**Aerodynamic:** (of an object) having a shape that reduces the drag from air moving past it.

**Airfoil:** A structure with curved surfaces designed to give the most favourable ratio of lift to drag in flight.

**Angle of Attack (AoA):** The angle between the chord of an airfoil and the direction of the surrounding undisturbed flow of gas or liquid.

**Axis:** An imaginary line about which a body rotates

**Circular Pitch:** The distance between two teeth along the pitch circle (length of the arc).

**Corrosion:** (of metal or other materials) be destroyed or damaged slowly by chemical action.

**Drag:** The longitudinal force applied by air or any other fluid on a moving object to slow it down.

**Driven Gear:** The gear that is rotated by the driver gear and is usually connected to the output shaft is known as the driven gear.

**Driver Gear:** The gear that causes the other gears to rotate is called the driver gear. 

**Force:** A force is something that changes the motion of an object or causes a stationary object to move or experience stress.

**Gear:** A circular machine part that is one of a set of toothed wheels.

**Kilowatt-hours:** A measure of electrical energy equivalent to a power consumption of 1,000 watts for 1 hour.

**Lift:** The perpendicular force applied by air or any other fluid on an object to raise it to a higher level.

**Longitudinal:** lengthwise

**Pinion:** A small gear engaging with a large gear.

**Pitch circle:** An imaginary circle that gives an idea about the size of a gear. 

**Pitch diameter:** The diameter of the pitch circle.
**Pressure angle:** The angle between the line defining the radius of the pitch circle to the point where the pitch circle intersects a tooth, and the tangent line to that tooth at that point.‚Äù (instructables)

**Resistance:** Stopping effect exerted by one material thing on another. In case of current and electricity, it is the property of a material to oppose the passage of electric current.

**Speed:** A measure of how fast or slow an object is travelling.

**Structural integrity:** Structural integrity is the ability of a structure to withstand an intended load without breaking down.

**Tangent:** (of a line or plane) touching, but not intersecting, a curve or curved surface.

**Torque:** A twisting force that tends to cause rotation.

**Vane:** A broad blade attached to a rotating axis or wheel which pushes or is pushed by wind or water and forms part of a machine or device such as a windmill, propeller, or a turbine.

**Watt:** the SI unit of power, corresponding to the amount of energy consumed or produced in unit time.
